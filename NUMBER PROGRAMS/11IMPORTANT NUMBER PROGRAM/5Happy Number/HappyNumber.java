//Q9)WAJP TO CHECK WHETHER A GIVEN NUMBER HAPPY NUMBER.PRINT TRUE IF THE NUMBER IS HAPPY OR PRINT FALSE IF THE NUMBER IS SAD.
/*
A Happy Number is a positive integer that eventually reaches 1 when you repeatedly replace it with the 
sum of the squares of its digits:

Start with any positive integer, and replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat this process
until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly in a cycle that doesn't include 1.

Example:
13 is a happy number because 13 â†’ 1^2 + 3^2 = 10 â†’ 1^2 + 0^2 = 1(Happy Number). & 4(Sad Number)
